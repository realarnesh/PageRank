Before running the code, please ensure both Main.java and
links.srt.gz are together in a folder names src. This requires
downloading the file (as it was to big to upload to moodle).

Whatever the parent folder of the src folder is, the output
will be in the bin folder (created if it doesn't exist).

To run the code, simply open it in your favorite IDE (I
use Eclipse) and click run.
